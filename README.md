# EXPENSE-TRACKER
It’s a digital notebook for money tracking helping people quickly monitor where their money goes.
It’s a simple web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where users can:

Add an expense → enter name (e.g., "Groceries"), amount, and category (Food, Transport, Bills, etc.).

View a list of expenses → each expense shows name, amount, category, date, and a delete button.

See totals → the app automatically calculates the total spent and a breakdown by category.

Store data → everything is saved in localStorage, so expenses remain even after refreshing.

Manage expenses → users can delete entries, filter by category, or extend it with features like CSV export or charts.
